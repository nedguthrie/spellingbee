# Spelling Bee Solver

Programs to solve the NYT Spelling Bee game and to deduce the valid word list. Each day at 9am the update_word_list.py will run automatically. This will solve the day's puzzle and compare the answers to the NYT answers. The valid word list will be updated by removing any answers that NYT did not deem valid.
